        <h3 id="About"><u>About</u></h3>

        <p id="P1">As a student tutor at the University of the Free State, I help first-year programming students understand and solve problems when building basic C# applications. This role has enhanced my software development skills and reinforced my passion for technology.

            I am also pursuing a degree in Computer Information Systems, where I have gained valuable experience in low-level project development using C# and SQL databases. I have learned how to create efficient and user-friendly applications that meet the needs and expectations of various clients and users.
            
            In addition to my technical expertise, I have developed exceptional leadership skills through my involvement in student organizations and activities. I have served as a student leader, a third-year representative, and a member of the Golden Key International Honour Society, where I have fostered teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills.
            
            I am always eager to expand my skill set and embrace new challenges, as I believe that continuous learning is key to success in this rapidly changing industry. I am now actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in a professional setting, where I can contribute to the development of innovative solutions and make a positive impact.</p>
